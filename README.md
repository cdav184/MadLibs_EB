There was once a TWENTY YEAR OLD boy named Pete.
He lived alone on a island,
because he had SMALL smelly feet. 
He wished that he could live on dry land,
But when the came near, 
The people would jeer
And he’d QUICKLY swim away in defeat. 


He searched and searched near and wide,
to find a cure for his CRAZY plight.
Then one AFTERNOON, while waiting for low tide
he grabbed all the APPLES in sight,
and QUICKLY rubbed them on his soles,
then they played their roles.
“Finally! No more stink!” Pete cried
