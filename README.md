There was once a -age- boy named Pete.
He lived alone on a island,
because he had -size adjective- smelly feet. 
He wished that he could live on dry land,
But when the came near, 
The people would jeer
And he’d -adjective- swim away in defeat. 


He searched and searched near and wide,
to find a cure for his -adjective- plight.
Then one -time-, while waiting for low tide
he grabbed all the -fruit noun- in sight,
and -adjective- rubbed them on his soles,
then they played their roles.
“Finally! No more stink!” Pete cried
